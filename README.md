# Rails Lite

I wanted to understand how rails worked from the inside out, so I built a basic version. This is based on Active Record Lite (https://github.com/buddylamers/active_record_lite) 

I build a stripped-down and basic version of rails functionality with the bare minimum to make a website:

Controllers
Whitelisted Params hash
Session Cookie
Router
WEBRICK server

I learned how ApplicationController renders and uses sessions, how to parse params with regular expressions, and in general a lot more about how Rails works.

I feel like I am able to better use Rails after this project.

If you're feeling extra fancy you can run [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)!
just type `guard`
